# Student Registration System

A simple Python application that simulates a student registering for a university course using object-oriented principles.

## Purpose

This application demonstrates the use of classes, object relationships (association and aggregation), and method interaction in a basic registration workflow.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have **Python 3** installed.
2. Clone this repository or download the files.
3. Open a terminal and run:

## Features
1. Define and display course information
2. Register a student for a course
3. Print registration confirmation with timestamp

## Limitations
1. No persistent storage (data is not saved after the program ends)
2. Only one registration per run
3. Basic CLI interface only

## Changelog
1. Initial commit: Created base project structure
2. Added classes: Student, Course, Registration
3. Completed logic: Registration process flow and CLI output



```bash
python main.py
