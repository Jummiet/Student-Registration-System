# Student Registration System

A simple Python application that simulates a student registering for a university course using object-oriented principles.

## Purpose

This application demonstrates the use of classes, object relationships (association and aggregation), and method interaction in a basic registration workflow.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have **Python 3** installed.
2. Clone this repository or download the files.
3. Open a terminal and run:

## Features
1. Define and display course information
2. Register a student for a course
3. Print registration confirmation with timestamp

## Limitations
1. No persistent storage (data is not saved after the program ends)
2. Only one registration per run
3. Basic CLI interface only

## Changelog
1. Initial commit: Created base project structure
2. Added classes: Student, Course, Registration
3. Completed logic: Registration process flow and CLI output


## Reflection on Version Control

During the project, I utilized Git as a robust tool for managing code changes and maintaining an organized project structure. I established a series of commits after each significant milestone, including the initial setup of the project environment, the creation of key classes, and the rigorous testing of core logic components.

Git proved invaluable for streamlining task organization. Its features enabled me to track my progress meticulously and provided the flexibility to revert any changes when I encountered errors or bugs. 

In the beginning, I struggled with committing my changes frequently, which led to a few challenges in tracking my development process. However, I quickly adapted by segmenting my work into smaller, manageable tasks, which facilitated regular commits and enhanced my workflow efficiency. 

In collaborative settings, using version control tools like Git is crucial, as it empowers multiple developers to work concurrently on the same codebase. This approach not only minimizes the risk of conflicts arising from overlapping changes but also allows team members to conduct thorough code reviews through pull requests, ensuring higher quality and maintainability of the code.
